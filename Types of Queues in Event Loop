Sure! Here's your cleaned-up version without emojis, while keeping the formatting and content intact:

1. What is the difference between the microtask queue and the macrotask queue?

Microtask queue**: Runs immediately after the current call stack is empty and before the next macrotask.
Macrotask queue**: Runs after microtasks are finished. Scheduled for the next tick of the event loop.

2. Which has higher priority?

Microtasks have higher priority.
After each macrotask (e.g., setTimeout), the engine empties the microtask queue first before proceeding.

3. Examples

| Type       | Examples                                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microtasks | Promise.then(), catch(), finally(), queueMicrotask()         |
| Macrotasks | setTimeout(), setInterval(), setImmediate() (Node), DOM events |

4. Output and Explanation

console.log("start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("macrotask"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("microtask"));

console.log("end");

Output:

start
end
microtask
macrotask

Explanation:

console.log("start") and console.log("end") run in the main call stack.
Promise.then() (microtask) runs after the call stack but before setTimeout() (macrotask).

5. What happens if a microtask schedules another microtask?

The new microtask is queued and executed after the current microtask completes, before moving to macrotasks.

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("microtask 1");
  queueMicrotask(() => console.log("nested microtask 2"));
});

Output:

microtask 1
nested microtask 2

6. Can a long-running microtask block rendering or events?

Yes.
Since the event loop must finish all microtasks before rendering, a large or infinite microtask chain can block rendering, making the UI unresponsive.

7. Which runs first: setTimeout() or Promise.then()?

Promise.then() runs first.

setTimeout(() => console.log("timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("promise"));

Output:

promise
timeout

Because Promise.then() is a microtask.

8. Why prefer queueMicrotask() over setTimeout()?

queueMicrotask() is faster: it runs before any macrotask.
Useful for splitting heavy logic into small chunks without waiting for a full event loop tick.

queueMicrotask(() => {
  // High-priority background task
});

9. How does the event loop ensure fairness with many microtasks?

It doesn't inherently enforce fairness.
If you keep scheduling new microtasks within microtasks, it can cause starvation — macrotasks never get a chance.

Promise.resolve().then(function repeat() {
  queueMicrotask(repeat); // starves the loop
});

Use caution — avoid infinite microtask chains.

10. Real-world bug example

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  Promise.resolve().then(() => while(true) {}); // blocks rendering
});

This blocks rendering or event processing — because microtasks run before repaint and can block the main thread.

Summary

| Microtasks                           | Macrotasks                       |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Run before repaint                   | Run on next tick                 |
| High priority                        | Lower priority                   |
| Use for: quick fixes, logic chaining | Use for: delayed work, UI events |
